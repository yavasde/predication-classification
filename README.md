# Predication Classification and Copredication Detection


Accompanying code for our RANLP paper "Identifying Semantic Argument Types in Predication and Copredication Contexts: A Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Approach". It is only for representational purposes. [Link](https://cococo.phil.hhu.de/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/RANLP_2023_copredication.pdf)


It contains the code for the extraction of the relation embedding ```extract_relation_embedding.py```, copredication detection ```copredication_detection.ipynb``` and adjective data generation with masked language modelling ```data_generation_with_MLM.ipynb```


It also contains the multilingual test data (Chinese, German, Turkish, English, Italian) for predication classification and copredication detection ```multilingual_test_data``` and multilingual classifier for Artifact and Event semantic types trained with XLM-RoBERTa representations ```classifiers```.




Feel free to experiment with different languages and different examples.
